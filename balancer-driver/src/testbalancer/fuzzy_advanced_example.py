Fuzzy Control Systems: Advanced Example
=======================================

The `tipping problem <./plot_tipping_problem_newapi.html>`_ is a classic,
simple example. If you're new to this, start with the `Fuzzy Control Primer
<../userguide/fuzzy_control_primer.html>`_ and move on to the tipping problem.

This example assumes you're familiar with those topics. Go on. We'll wait.


Typical Fuzzy Control System
----------------------------

Many fuzzy control systems are tasked to keep a certain variable close to a
specific value. For instance, the temperature for an industrial chemical
process might need to be kept relatively constant. In order to do this, the
system usually knows two things:

* The `error`, or deviation from the ideal value
* The way the error is changing. This is the mathematical first derivative;
  we'll call it `delta`

From these two values we can construct a system which will act appropriately.


Set up the Fuzzy Control System
-------------------------------

We'll use the new control system API for this problem. It would be far too
complicated to model manually!

Final thoughts
--------------

This example used a number of new, advanced techniques which may be helpful in
practical fuzzy system design:

* A highly sparse (maximally sparse) system
* Controll of Term names generated by `automf`
* A long and logically complicated ruleset, with order-of-operations respected
* Control of the cache flushing on creation of a ControlSystemSimulation,
  which can be tuned as needed depending on memory constraints
* Repeated runs of a ControlSystemSimulation
* Creating and viewing a control surface in 3D.
